### Running Localizard with command-line arguments

Instead of using the interactive mode, you can execute specific commands directly:

#### Initialize Localizard

```sh
lzd init
```

This command starts by asking whether you want to create new locale files or use existing ones.

To skip this question, use one of the following options:

```sh
lzd init --new
```

This will create new locale files in the specified directory and generate a configuration file.

```sh
lzd init --link
```

This will prompt you to provide the path to your existing locale files. Localizard will scan the directory for `.json` files and generate a configuration file based on the detected locales.

##### Short options:

- `-n` ‚Üí Equivalent to `--new`
- `-l` ‚Üí Equivalent to `--link`

#### Adding a Translation

```sh
lzd add
```

You will be prompted to enter the JSON key and translations.

```
Enter the JSON key (e.g., home.content.body): home.content.body
Enter the translation for en (HOME.CONTENT.BODY): Welcome Home!
Enter the translation for hu (HOME.CONTENT.BODY): √údv itthon!
```

This updates your JSON files as follows:

**en.json:**

```json
{
  "HOME": {
    "CONTENT": {
      "BODY": "Welcome Home!"
    }
  }
}
```

**hu.json:**

```json
{
  "HOME": {
    "CONTENT": {
      "BODY": "√údv itthon!"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Editing a Translation

```sh
lzd edit
```

You will be prompted to enter the key to modify and the new translations.

```
Enter the JSON key to modify: home.content.body
Enter the new translation for en (HOME.CONTENT.BODY): Welcome!
Enter the new translation for hu (HOME.CONTENT.BODY): √údv!
```

#### Deleting a Translation

```sh
lzd delete
```

You will be prompted to enter the key to delete.
